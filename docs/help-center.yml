        question: How do I create or restore my Spixi account
        answer: |
          Create a new account

          1. Download and open Spixi.
          2. Tap Create new account.
          3. Choose a nickname and (optionally) a profile picture.
          4. Set a strong password – this protects both your wallet and your messages.
          5. Finish setup, then go to Settings → Backup and create a backup file so you can restore your account later.

          Restore an existing account

          1. Install and open Spixi on the new device.
          2. Tap Restore account.
          3. Select your backup file.
          4. Enter the password you used when creating that backup.
          5. After restore, your account and wallet will be available on this device.

          If the backup file or password is wrong or lost, the account cannot be recovered.

      - id: backup-account
        question: How do I back up my Spixi account safely
        answer: |
          1. Open Settings → Backup in Spixi.
          2. Tap Create backup and wait for the file to be generated.
          3. Save the backup file in a safe place (for example encrypted storage or an external drive).
          4. Store your password separately and securely – written down and kept offline is best.
          5. Use this backup file + password to restore your account on a new device.

          Anyone with both the backup file and password can access your account and IXI funds, so treat them like physical keys.

      - id: understand-spixi-address
        question: What is my Spixi address and when do I use it
        answer: |
          Your Spixi address is your core identifier in the Spixi  Ixian network.

          You use it to
          - Let others add you as a contact
          - Receive IXI payments
          - Link your identity to services that integrate with Spixi  Ixian

          You can share it by copying the text address or showing your QR code.
          You can change your nickname at any time, but your existing Spixi address for that account does not change.

      - id: address-vs-nickname-vs-ixi-name
        question: What's the difference between my nickname, Spixi address and IXI Name
        answer: |
          - Nickname  
            The name your contacts see in chats. Cosmetic only; you can change it anytime. Not used for payments or routing.

          - Spixi address  
            Your main cryptographic identifier. Used to add you as a contact and send IXI. Generated when you create your account.

          - IXI Name (when available)  
            A human-readable name that maps to your Spixi  IXI address, so others don't have to copy long strings.

          Think of it like this nickname = display name, Spixi address = raw ID, IXI Name = nice alias on top of the raw ID.

      - id: passwords-backups-recovery
        question: What should I know about passwords, backups and recovery
        answer: |
          Spixi is self-custodial – there is no "forgot password" and no central admin who can reset your account.

          To keep access to your account, you must have
          - The backup file
          - The correct password for that backup

          Good practices
          1. Use a unique, strong password that you don't reuse elsewhere.
          2. Create backups regularly, especially after big changes.
          3. Store both password and backup file in safe, separate, offline locations.

          Lose either one and that account (and its funds) are gone. That's the trade-off for not trusting a central party with your keys.

      - id: how-spixi-protects-data
        question: How does Spixi protect my privacy and data
        answer: |
          - Spixi uses the Ixian decentralized network – there is no single central chat server storing all messages.
          - Messages are stored locally on your device. If you delete the app or wipe the device, the history is gone unless you have your own backups.
          - Communication between you and your contacts is protected using strong encryption.
          - Payments are recorded on the Ixian blockchain; your wallet keys never leave your device.

          If someone gets full access to your device, they can still read what's on it – including Spixi. Your device security matters just as much as Spixi's protocol.

      - id: add-manage-contacts
        question: How do I add, remove or manage contacts in Spixi
        answer: |
          Add a contact

          1. Tap New chat or Add contact.
          2. Enter the person's Spixi address or IXI Name, or scan their QR code.
          3. Confirm and start the chat.

          Remove a contact

          1. Open the chat with that person.
          2. Tap their avatar or the chat info area.
          3. Choose Remove contact.

          Removing a contact cuts the secure session and stops new messages. You can always add them again later.

      - id: start-secure-chats-calls
        question: How do I start secure chats and calls in Spixi
        answer: |
          Start a chat

          1. Add the person as a contact (or pick an existing contact).
          2. Tap their name to open the chat.
          3. Type and send messages – they go over an encrypted channel.

          Start a voice call (if available in your build)

          1. Open the chat with the contact.
          2. Tap the call icon.
          3. Wait for the other side to accept.

          Calls and chats require both sides to have Spixi running and a working internet connection.

      - id: servers-groups-community
        question: Does Spixi support groups or community servers
        answer: |
          - Group chats may not be available in your current public version yet. They are planned as the protocol and app evolve.
          - You can use the Spixi Community Bot and other integrations to create shared spaces where multiple users can join and interact.

          Check the official Ixian  Spixi community channels for the latest information and public test servers.

      - id: send-ixi
        question: How do I send IXI from my Spixi wallet
        answer: |
          1. Open the Wallet tab in Spixi.
          2. Tap Send.
          3. Paste the recipient's IXI  Spixi address or scan their QR code.
          4. Enter the amount of IXI you want to send.
          5. Review the details, including the network fee.
          6. Confirm the transaction.

          Once broadcast, the transaction is recorded on the Ixian blockchain and cannot be reversed.

      - id: receive-ixi
        question: How do I receive IXI in Spixi
        answer: |
          1. Open the Wallet tab in Spixi.
          2. Tap Receive.
          3. Show your QR code or copy your IXI  Spixi address.
          4. Share it with the sender.

          When the transaction is confirmed on-chain, your balance will update. Confirmation time depends on network conditions and the sender's fee.

      - id: fees-and-costs
        question: Are there any fees when using Spixi and IXI
        answer: |
          - Chat messages and files – Sending messages in Spixi is free within protocol limits.
          - IXI payments – Each transaction includes a small network fee paid in IXI to have it processed and recorded on the blockchain.
          - The app itself – Spixi is free to download and use. There are no subscriptions or in-app "unlock basic features" fees.

          You only pay network fees when you actually send IXI.

    items:
      - id: what-are-mini-apps
        question: What are Mini Apps in Spixi
        answer: |
          Mini Apps are lightweight applications that run inside Spixi.

          They can be
          - Games (e.g. Tic-Tac-Toe, Pong)
          - Tools (whiteboard, calculators, utilities)
          - Service integrations that use Spixi's secure communication channel

          You open them from the Mini Apps section or from links shared in chats.

      - id: install-use-mini-apps
        question: How do I find, install and use Mini Apps
        answer: |
          1. Open the Mini Apps section in Spixi.
          2. Browse the list or use search to find an app.
          3. Tap a Mini App to view details.
          4. Tap Open (or Install, depending on UI) to start using it.
          5. Follow any on-screen instructions – some apps work in a chat context, others run as standalone tools.

          You can launch Mini Apps again later from the same section or from recent items, depending on your Spixi version.

      - id: mini-apps-permissions-safety
        question: Are Mini Apps safe and what permissions do they have
        answer: |
          - Mini Apps run on top of the Spixi  Ixian stack and share its encrypted transport.
          - Some Mini Apps may request access to
            - Read certain messages in a chat
            - Send messages on your behalf in that chat
            - Interact with your IXI wallet (for example, to generate payment requests)

          Only use Mini Apps from sources you trust, read permission prompts carefully, and remove any app you're not comfortable with.

      - id: messages-not-sending
        question: What can I do if my messages are not sending or delivering
        answer: |
          1. Check your internet connection (Wi-Fi or mobile data) on both sides.
          2. Make sure you can load a website or another app.
          3. Ask your contact if Spixi is running on their device.
          4. Close and reopen Spixi; if needed, restart your device.
          5. If you recently removed and re-added the contact, wait a bit for the new secure session to establish.

          If nothing helps, collect logs (if available) and contact support with details (device, OS, what you tried).

      - id: backup-restore-issues
        question: Why can't I restore my backup or open my account
        answer: |
          Common reasons
          - The backup file doesn't match the account you're trying to restore.
          - The password is incorrect (wrong case, typo, or old password).
          - The backup file is corrupted or incomplete.

          What you can try
          1. Double-check that you're using the correct file.
          2. Enter the password slowly and carefully.
          3. If you have multiple backups, try an older one.

          If none of them work, there is no way to bypass the encryption. That account cannot be recovered.
